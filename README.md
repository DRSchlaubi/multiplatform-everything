# Multiplatform Everything

I got annoyed that a lot of stuff sucked and/or wasn't multiplatform so I made a repo with everything I need and also multiplatform for everything.

Everything is licensed BSD 3-Clause (NON-AI), PRs are welcome.

- Multiplatform WeakRef/WeakMap/WeakValueMap
- Binary editing tools (ByteArray only)
